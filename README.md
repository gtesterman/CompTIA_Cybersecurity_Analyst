# CompTIA CySA+

I am currently in the process of completing the CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+) certification.

The CySA+ is an industry-standard certification for developing the essential skills in becoming a cybersecurity professional. It focuses on fundamental topics in security operations, while also going more in-depth than the CompTIA Security+ .

<h3>What the certification exam consists of:</h3>

- 165 minutes in the exam room

- Up to 85 multiple choice and performance-based questions

- Passing score of at least 750 on a scale of 100-900

<h3>Exam prep and tools I used:</h3>

- CompTIA CySA+ Exam Objectives (free)

- Jason Dion's CySA+ CS0-003 Udemy Course (<$20 on sale)

- Jason Dion's CySA+ CS0-003 Practice Tests (<$15 on sale)

- Sybex CySA+ Study Guide ($40)

- YouTube

Although I am trying a wide range of study materials, the objectives in this certification seem close to what I learned in the Security+ and my university courses. I am very excited to continue my cybersecurity journey and work toward another achievement in tech.
