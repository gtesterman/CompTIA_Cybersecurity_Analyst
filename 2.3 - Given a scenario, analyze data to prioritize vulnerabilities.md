<h1>2.3 - Given a scenario, analyze data to prioritize vulnerabilities</h1>

<h2>Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) interpretation</h2>

<h3>Base Score</h3>
	
  - Attack vectors (AV)
		
    - How it is possible for the attacker to exploit the vulnerability

|Value|Description|Score|
| --- | --- | --- |
| Physical (AV:P) | The attacker is required to physically touch the device | 0.20|
| Local (AV:L) | Vulnerable component is not bound to the network; attack may need to be locally connected to the device. | 0.55 |
| Adjacent Network (AV:A) | The attacker is bound to the same physical/logical network | 0.62 |
| Network (AV:N) | The vulnerability is exploitable with remote access over a network | 0.85 |

  - Attack complexity (AC)
    - How complex the conditions are to exploit the vulnerability

| Value	| Description	| Score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| High (AC:H)	| Exploiting the vulnerability requires complex conditions or conditions that are difficult to find	| 0.44 |
| Low (AC:L)	| Complex conditions do not exist for this vulnerability	| 0.77 | 

  - Privileges required (PR)
	  - The type of user privileges the attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability

| Value	| Description	| Score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| High (PR:H)	| Attacker needs admin privileges to perform the attack |	0.27 (or 0.50) |
| Low (PR:L)	| Attack may be performed with basic user privileges	| 0.62 (or 0.68) |
| None (PR:N)	| No privileges are required to perform the attack	| 0.85 |

  - User interaction (UI)
    - Whether another human is required to be involved for the attack

| Value	| Description	| Score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None (UI:N)	| Exploitation may occur without other human interaction	| 0.85 |
|Required (UI:R)	| Another human is required to interact for the vulnerability to be exploited (ex. Clicking a link or acting on a phishing email)	| 0.62 |

  - Scope (S)
      - Whether a vulnerability can affect systems beyond the scope of the vulnerability

| Value	| Description	| Score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unchanged (S:U)	| The vulnerability can only affect resources with the same security authority	| Based on privileges required (PR) metric |
| Changed (S:C)	| The vulnerability can affect resources outside of the scope of security authority	| Based on privileges required (PR) metric |

<h3>Impact Metrics</h3> 

  - Confidentiality (C)
    - The impact to the confidentiality of information
			
| Value	| Description	| Score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None (C:N) | There is no impact	| 0.00 |
| Low (C:L)	| Some loss of confidentiality; attacker does not control what information is obtained	| 0.22 |
| High (C:H)	| Total loss of confidentiality; all information is compromised	| 0.56 |

  - Integrity (I)
    - The integrity of information with a successfully exploited vulnerability
		
| Value	| Description	| Score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None (I:N)	| There is no impact	| 0.00 |
| Low (I:L)	| Modification is possible; however, attacker cannot control what information is modified	| 0.22 |
| High (I:H)	| Total loss of integrity; attacker can change any information at will	| 0.56 |


  - Availability (A)
	  - The disruption of availability if the vulnerability is successfully exploited

| Value	| Description	| Score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None (A:N)	| There is no impact	| 0.00 |
| Low (A:L)	| Interruptions in resource availability; reduced performance	| 0.22 |
| High (A:H)	| Total loss of availability; system is shut down	 | 0.56 |

<h3> Validation </h3>

  - True/false positives
    - True positive: Scanner report is accurate
    - False positive: Scanner reports a vulnerability that does not exist
	
  - True/false negatives
    - True negative: Negative scanner report is accurate
    - False negative: Negative report is inaccurate; vulnerability does exist

<h3> Context awareness </h3>

  - Internal
    - Exists in the environment
    
  - External
    - Directly connected to the Internet
    - Much more severe
  
  - Isolated
    - System is on an isolated network
    - Less severe

<h3> Exploitability/weaponization </h3>

<h3> Asset value </h3>

  - Plays a role in prioritization
  - Higher value assets present more risk

<h3> Zero-day </h3>

  - Vulnerabilities that are not disclosed
  - Unknown to the product vendors
  - Often compromised by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors
